Probability review: dice rolling game
1 point possible (graded)
Alice and Bob play a game where two fair six-sided dice are rolled.

Alice gets $1 if the sum of the numbers of the two dice is a prime number. (The number  is not prime.)

Bob gets $3 if the numbers on the two dice are the same (e.g. 1-1, 2-2, â€¦).

Who makes more money on average (i.e. in expectation)?
